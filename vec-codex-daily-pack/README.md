# VEC Codex (Daily Use)

One-repo workflow for Tony's **Glitchwalker / VEC** project.

## Structure
```
library/  → master codex files (JSON = source of truth, CSV/TXT derived)
logs/     → daily entries (one file per day, Europe/Athens)
docs/     → reviews & CHANGELOG
sigils/   → PNG/SVG glyphs (optional)
```
## Daily routine (≤ 5 minutes)
1. Open `logs/2025-09-19.md` (or create today's file if not present).
2. Paste the daily block I give you in chat.
3. Click **Commit**. Done.

## Weekly/Monthly
- I provide a weekly review for `docs/CHANGELOG.md`.
- Once a month, we pin the updated `library/vec_library_codex.json` and re-derive CSV/TXT.

## How to start (GitHub web UI)
1. Create a new repo: **vec-codex** (private or public).
2. Click **Add file → Upload files** and upload everything from this ZIP.
3. Commit. You're ready.
